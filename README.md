# Resume Gap Analyzer

An explainable Python-based system that analyzes skill gaps between resumes and job descriptions using transparent text processing and deterministic logic.

## Why this project?
Most resume screening tools rely on black-box AI models that provide little insight into *why* a candidate is a good or bad match.  
This project focuses on **explainability, correctness, and interview-readiness**.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Resume & Job Description text normalization
- Rule-based skill extraction
- Skill gap analysis (matched vs missing skills)
- Transparent scoring logic
- Actionable improvement suggestions

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Regex-based text processing
- Rule-based NLP (no black-box ML)

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — developed day-by-day with a strong focus on fundamentals and design clarity.
